              Liability for Contents
            </h3>
            <p>
              The contents of our pages were created with the utmost care.
              However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and
              timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are
              responsible for our own content on these pages under the general
              laws according to § 7 para.1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we
              are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or
              stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances
              that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the
              use of information under the general laws remain unaffected.
              However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point
              in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known.
              If we become aware of any such infringements, we will remove this
              content immediately.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-5">Liability for Links</h3>
            <p>
              Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on
              whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume
              any liability for these external contents. The respective provider
              or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of
              the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
              violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
              recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control
              of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without
              concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of
              any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

              Please note that data transmission over the Internet (e.g.,
              communication by e-mail) may have security gaps. A complete
              protection of data against access by third parties is not
              possible.

            <p>
              Daytistics uses PostHog to gather product analytics. In line with
              GDPR, we only collect, store, and process personal data when there
              is a clear and lawful basis. Personal data includes any
              information that can identify an individual, such as names, email
              addresses, location data, or cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Consent:</strong> Before any personal data is captured, we
              obtain explicit, unambiguous consent. Users can withdraw their
              consent at any time, which will halt further data capture and
              processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data Security:</strong> Data is transmitted via HTTPS and
              is protected through encryption and other technical and
              organizational measures. In case of a data breach, affected users
              will be notified within 72 hours unless data is rendered unusable
              through encryption.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Rights:</strong> Users have the right to request
              deletion ("right to be forgotten") of their personal data.
              Requests can be made via our support channels and will be
              processed promptly, including removal from our PostHog instance.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Configuration:</strong> For users within the EU, data is
              processed on servers in the EU or anonymized if processed
              elsewhere. Users may opt out of tracking at any time using the
              provided mechanisms (e.g., by calling
              <code>posthog.opt_out_capturing()</code>).
