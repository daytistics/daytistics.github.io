            I don't know why you would read this, if you aren't a lawyer, who
            wants to sue me. But if you are, please don't. I'm just a student,
            who is passioned about coding and wants to learn more about it. I
            don't have the money to pay a lawyer. So please, if you have any
            concerns, just contact me and we can talk about it. I'm sure we can
            find a solution.
